This repository is an adaptation of the original first place solution of Kaggle's painter by numbers challenge.
Original competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/painter-by-numbers/overview
Original first place code: https://github.com/inejc/painters

An overview of the repository:

1. An overview of the whole modeling process is here:
http://blog.kaggle.com/2016/11/17/painter-by-numbers-competition-1st-place-winners-interview-nejc-ilenic/

2. Pedl scripts:
    1) data_dirs_organizer.py organizes data directories and does data pre-processing
    2) model_def_standard.py is the model definition using pedl's Keras trial interface.
    3) pedl_config are the configuration files for running this repository
    4) train_cnn.py contains the actual definition of model, which is imported in model_def_standard.py
    5) __init__.py

3. Other scripts
    1) scripts with helper functions: config.py, data_provider.py, normalization.py (a hack we used to tackle
    the problem that after keras update, the BatchNormalization layer with mode=2 is no longer available),
    utils.py, validation.py (helper functionalities for doing pairwise validation)
    2) scripts to IGNORE: cnn_embedding.py, submission.py. These were from the original baseline and it is
    hard for us to reuse code in these two scripts so we have rewrote them (based on our understanding)
    submission_jxs.py

4. To run the code in pedl:
1) if you are running it on soak, then data_check is the data directory. Otherwise:
    i. Download the dataset (either the whole train.zip or a subset of the training data as in here:
    https://www.kaggle.com/datasets, and all other data such as test.zip, and the data information csv files)
    ii. Run data_dirs_organizer.py to set up data repositories and do data pre-processing
    iii. Once you have the data set up, run the pedl scripts in the usual way
    iv. If you want to create submission files and submit to Kaggle, run submission_jxs.py
